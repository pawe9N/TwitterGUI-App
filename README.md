# TwitterGUI-App
TwitterGUI App was created for purpose of learning python, twitter API (python-twitter library) and PyQt5.

## Getting Started

If you want to use this program, you have to download all files of this repository.
Then you should install all requirements which you can see in requirements.txt. 
To install it you should use the following pip command in your console: 
```python
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt).
```
After that you have to create keys_class.py file in classes directory and input the following code with your keys there:

```python
class Keys:
	def __init__(self):
		self.consumer_key = "Input your consumer key"
		self.consumer_secret = "Input your consumer secret key"
		self.access_token = "Input your access token key"
		self.access_secret = "Input your access secret key"
```

After that you will can open an application with your personal twitter account.
